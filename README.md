# Loan Eligibility Prediction Project

This project uses machine learning techniques to predict loan eligibility based on applicant details. It involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training, and evaluation. The goal is to build a robust predictive model to assist financial institutions in making accurate and efficient loan approval decisions.

## Project Overview
Loan eligibility prediction is critical for banks and financial institutions to automate and streamline loan approval processes. This project leverages machine learning models to classify whether an applicant is eligible for a loan based on income, credit history, and more.

## Features
- **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing data.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Gaining insights into the data with visualizations and statistical analysis.
- **Modeling**: Training and testing multiple machine learning models to find the best-performing one.
- **Evaluation**: Assessing model performance using metrics like accuracy.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For code implementation and documentation

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains details about applicants, such as income, credit history, education, and loan amount. It is structured and has been preprocessed for this task.

## Project Workflow
1. Importing and exploring the dataset
2. Preprocessing the data:
   - Handling missing values
   - Encoding categorical variables
   - Scaling numeric features
3. Performing EDA to derive insights
4. Training and evaluating machine learning models
5. Comparing model performance and selecting the best model
6. Making predictions and summarizing findings
